# MiFare Classic Universal toolKit (MFCUK)
{ caption }

## Install
### Prerequisites
* [LibNFC 1.8.0](https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc/releases) 
* _pkg-config_, _automake_ and _libtool_

### Compiling
```bash
autoreconf -is
./configure
make
(sudo) make install # optional
```

### Running
Basic usage, recover key A for sector n.0, with a verbosity level of 2: `mfcuk -C -R 0:A -v 2`
Weak card, recover key B for sector n.1 with a verbosity level of 3: `mfcuk -C -R 1:B -w 6 -v 3`

### CONTRUBUTORS
* Romuald Conty <romuald@libnfc.org> - porting to libnfc 1.3.x, 1.4.x, 1.5.x
* Nethemba Core Team <mifare@nethemba.com> - core AC, AM, configure and packaging
* DrSchottky <> - weak cards patch, fix 0x03 error

## WEAK CARDS PATCH
mfcuk does not handle cards that always respond with NACK to failed auth attempts. This is the cause of 0x03 error on some cards.
@Stewart8 [solved the problem](https://github.com/nfc-tools/mfcuk/issues/39) and @DrSchottky applied his patch to mfcuk source with some adjustments, like:
- no more crashes with 1M+ candidates
- configurable maxhi/lo threshold
- "weak card mode" can be turned on/off selectively
To use mfcuk in weak card mode add '-w threshold' to cmdline args. Suggested threshold val: >=6

## TODO
0. Remove dead-code/commented block after testing
1. Proper error handling in some cases (not critical errors, but nice to have checks in place)
2. Integrate with MFOC into MFCUK
3. Create sort of GUI
4. Improve the performance (though not bad)
5. Optimize bits operations
6. Periodically save the state (or most important part of it at least) such as of Nt/Nr arrays, etc., so that it can later be resumed on the same card
7. Calibration methodology and routine for MFCUK to determine best field on/off delays so that it generates the lowest entropy for tag's Nt values
