mfcuk does not handle cards that always respond with NACK to failed auth attempts. This is the cause of 0x03 error on some cards.

@Stewart8 solved the problem (https://github.com/nfc-tools/mfcuk/issues/39) and I applied his patch to mfcuk source with some adjustments
-no more crashes with 1M+ candidates
-configurable maxhi/lo threshold
-"weak card mode" can be turned on/off selectively

To use mfcuk in weak card mode add '-w threshold' to cmdline args. Suggested threshold val: >=6
